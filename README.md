# Welcome to Xpath Diner

It's a fun game to learn and practice Xpath selectors.

To play, visit: [vzcodes.github.io/xpath-diner/](https://vzcodes.github.io/xpath-diner/)

Note: this is just a fork from the main xpath diner with code located at https://github.com/TopSwagCode/xpath-diner. 

As of May 2025 the links located at [topswagcode.com/](http://topswagcode.com/xpath) don't work. 

Perhaps we can also add more levels in the near future. 

### Original CSS diner game can be found here:
